a function void renderMap(int * mapArray, int mX, int mY, int blockSize, SDL_Renderer* renderer) has been created to draw map on the screen based on an array of numbers that represent different types of objects in the map. 

the array of numbers are included along with the renderMap function in a map.cpp file.
